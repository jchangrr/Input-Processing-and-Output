# Input-Processing-and-Output
Problem 1: For this problem you will be writing a program that calculates how much a person can earn by investing in a high yield savings account. The program should ask the user for an initial deposit amount and an interest rate. The program will then generate a 3 month projection that illustrates how much money the user can expect to earn. Assume that interest is compunded monthly (i.e. if your account earns a rate of 12% interest annually then you would earn a rate of 1% per month). You can assume that the user will enter reasonable input values (i.e. all inputted values will be valid positive floating point numbers.) 

Problem 2: Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers. These numbers will always be >= 0 and <= 999. You can assume that the user will always supply you with a integers within this range. Next, compute the sum of the digits represented in each place value in that number. For example, if the numbers supplied are 123 and 456 you would compute the sum of the ones place (3+6), the sum of the tens place (2+5) and the sum of the hundreds place (1+4).

Problem 3: You have recently been hired by Microsoft to write a program that calculates the distance between two blocks in the popular "Minecraft" game. A block in Minecraft can be oriented in in the game using a 3D point denoted as (x,y,z). Your program will prompt the user to enter in two points of two separate blocks and then determine how far away these blocks are. Here's how your program should work:
Ask the user for Block #1's x component
Ask the user for Block #1's y component
Ask the user for Block #1's z component
Ask the user for Block #2's x component
Ask the user for Block #2's y component
Ask the user for Block #2's z component
Compute x, y and z distance between the two blocks
Compute the straight-line distance between the two blocks formatted to two decimal places.

Problem 4: 
Prompt the user to enter in a number of milliliters.
Convert the supplied input into teaspoon (tsp), tablespoon (tbsp), microliter (uL) and nanoliter (nL).
Output the results.
Next, list out at least five ways to "crash" the program and document your errors. Include examples of at least one syntax, one logic, and one run-time error.
